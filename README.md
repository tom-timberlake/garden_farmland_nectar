This project contains the data and R code used in the manuscript entitled: 'Gardens reduce seasonal hunger gaps for farmland pollinators'

If all data files and R files listed below are present in the working directory, the code should run from start to finish and generate all of the figures and statistics used in the MS

Files in the repository include:

R_script_garden_farmland_nectar_gaps.R - this is an R script with all code used in the analyses and annotations to show how each phase of analysis was conducted.

Garden_nectar_producton.csv - datafile with raw values of nectar recorded in gardens

Habitat_nectar_phenology.csv - datafile with values of nectar recorded in separate farmland and garden habitats throughout the year

Farm_garden_nectar_production.csv - datafile with values of nectar production in all farmland habitats combined and in gardens

Farm_garden_nectar_supply_demand.csv - datafile with values of nectar available per bee (i.e. nectar availability/bumblebee abundance) and daily nectar requirements of individual bees throughout the year

BeeWalk data_South-West.csv - datafile with records of bumblebee abundance in farmland versus garden habitats throughout the year, taken from BEEWalk transect data in SW UK.

ALL_BEE-STEWARD_RESULTS.csv - outputs from the BEE-STEWARD agent-based-model implemented in Netlogo

Twelve farms_habitat areas.csv - data to compare the habitat coverage areas of our three study farms with equivalent values for 12 farms in Southwest UK to assess their representativeness of the wider region

Twelve farms_seasonal nectar.csv - data to compare the seasonal nectar values of our three study farms with equivalent values for 12 farms in Southwest UK to assess their representativeness of the wider region
